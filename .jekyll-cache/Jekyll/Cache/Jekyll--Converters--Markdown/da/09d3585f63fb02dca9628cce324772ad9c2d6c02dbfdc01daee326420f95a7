<p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

<p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>

<p>Flat is better than nested.</p>

<p>Sparse is better than dense.</p>

<p>Readability counts.</p>

<p>Special cases arenâ€™t special enough to break the rules.</p>

<p>Although practicality beats purity.</p>

<p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>

<p>Unless explicitly silenced.</p>

<p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>

<p>There should be oneâ€“ and preferably only one â€“obvious way to do it.</p>

<p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless youâ€™re Dutch.</p>

<p>Now is better than never.</p>

<p>Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.</p>

<p>If the implementation is hard to explain, itâ€™s a bad idea.</p>

<p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>
